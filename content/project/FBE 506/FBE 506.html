<p>This project deals with applying all the concepts learned in FBE 506 as much as possible. First, we will import the necessary libraries to start our quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>We see that the data is imported properly. Differently from quantmod, tidyquant is a package that imports stock prices from yahoo finance in a tibble format, which helps visualizing the data more easily by using ggplot2 package, while quantmod import data in a xts format.</p>
<p>We have the price data, so we are going to code to get the monthly returns for each stocks to calculate returns and risks for each stock.</p>

<p>Now, we see the overall risk % return of the stock. By using ggplotly, we can point to the visualized data and directly see each stock’s performance figure and compare it with different stocks.</p>
<p>From the scatter plot, we can see that some stocks have lower risks but offer higher return. Thus, we will create a portfolio with, PEP, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, and AMD. Before we go over any deep analysis, we will implement several basic quantitative analysis regarding stocks’ performance</p>

<p>Apparently, AMD has the biggest volatility compared to other stocks while PEP showed the lowest risk among the 5 stocks. However, AMD’s return was significant as the risk was high. Since AMD is a growth stock and PEP is a matured company, the outcome seems obvious.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to verify whether the return of the stock is normally distributed and also compute the correlation of each stock.</p>

<p>According to the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the expected return of an asset should be the following: Ra = Rf + (Beta*Risk premium) where Ra refers to return of the asset and Rf refers to risk-free rate. Since we need to build the Security market line of portfolio, we will use the 10yr bond yield as the risk-free rate.</p>
<p>To build a SML, we need 1. Portfolio Return 2. Market Return 3. Risk-Free Rate. Since we have the portfolio return and market return data, we will have to prepare for the risk-free rate data.</p>

<p>From the scatter plot, it is apparent that our portfolio has lower risk but higher risk than investing in AMZN due to the asset distribution effect.</p>
<p>Since we saw our portfolio risk &amp; return, we are going to calculate the Beta, which indicates the volatility compared to S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Refer that the formula for computing beta is :
{beta}_{portfolio} = cov(R_p, R_m)/sigma_m)
Or it is the slope of the regression line between market return and portfolio return</p>

<p>We can see that the Beta of the portfolio using both methods give the same figure. The beta of the portfolio 1.25, meaning that it is 25% more volatile than the market. This figure is valid since the p value of the slope is lower than 0.05.</p>

<p>From the regression result, we see that the p-value of Covid is higher than 0.05 which means that the economy shut down didn’t statistically affect the Alpha return significantly. Also, the p-value of the risk premium is higher than 0.05 so there wasn’t statistical effect on market risk.</p>

<p>Calculating 2% VaR indicates that 2% of the time, the return of an asset could be below certain percentage. For instance, the 30-month 2% VaR of portfolio return was 18%, which means that the portfolio could lose 18% of return in one month by 2% while 98% of time the return would be higher than negative 18%, To summarize the data, the VaR of the portfolio was higher than that of the ETF, and it has a chance of losing over 40% of return in 1 year.</p>

<p>Now, we are going to implement a two-sample mean test and varaince analysis to find whether the risk and return of portfolio and S&amp;P 500 is indifferent or not.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>axcx &lt;- left_join(market_return,port_ret_tp.c, by=&#39;date&#39;) %&gt;%
  tk_xts()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Non-numeric columns being dropped: date</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Using column `date` for date_var.</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#ANOVA 
var.test(x=market_return$market_ret,y=port_ret_tp.c$port_ret_GMV, conf.level = 0.95)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<p>Unfortunately, there wasn’t any statistical difference in risk &amp; return in investing in two different assets; thus investing in GMV portfolio is statistically same as investing in S&amp;P 500 index</p>
